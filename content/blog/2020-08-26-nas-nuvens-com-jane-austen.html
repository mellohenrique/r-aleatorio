<p>Faz tempo que não trabalho com avaliação computacional de texto. Por causa disto resolvi fazer um exercício simples de criação de 5 nuvens de palavras dos 5 romances completos de Jane Austen. Para isso construi uma pequena função para fazer nuvens de palavras.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(magrittr)

nuvem_de_palavras &lt;- function(livro){
  data.frame(txt = livro) %&gt;% 
    tidytext::unnest_tokens(word, txt) %&gt;%
    dplyr::anti_join(tidytext::stop_words) %&gt;% 
    dplyr::count(word)  %&gt;%
    dplyr::rename(freq = n) %&gt;%
    dplyr::arrange(desc(freq)) %&gt;%
    dplyr::top_n(n = 250, wt = freq) %&gt;% 
    wordcloud2::wordcloud2()
}</code></pre>
<p>Espero que seja divertido observar as palavras mais usadas por uma escritora tão querida.</p>
